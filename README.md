# PurrVim ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ ✨  

*Nya~* ようこそ! Welcome to **PurrVim**, your fluffy neko companion for Vim! This *kawaii* plugin brings adorable *kao moji* and uplifting messages to give you that extra *ganbatte* while coding. Ready to make your terminal *kirakira* and full of love? Let's go! 🌸  

## 🌟 What Makes It Kawaii? 🌟  
🐱 **Neko faces:** Cute expressions like (=^・ω・^=) or ฅ(ﾐ⚈ ﻌ ⚈ﾐ)ฅ appear randomly to make you smile!  
💌 **Encouraging messages:** "You're coding purrfectly! ♡" or "にゃんにゃん Keep going!" to warm your heart.  
✨ **Subtle sparkles:** Just a little *hikari* to make coding more *tanoshii*!  
😴 **Sleepy mode:** If you stop for too long, the neko gets *nemui* and asks, "More coding please~?"  
🎀 **Customization:** Because even a *nyanko* knows your workflow is special!  

## 🐾 How to Install This Neko? 🐾  
So easy it’s like a purr! Just clone the repo into your Vim:  
```sh  
git clone https://github.com/SergioBonatto/PurrVim.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/PurrVim  
```  
Restart Vim and your neko will welcome you with a *"Nya~! ✧･ﾟ"*  

## 🎀 How to Play with It? 🎀  
- `:KawaiiCat` – Summon your neko for a motivational purr!  
- `:KawaiiSparkle` – Activate *hikari mode* and sparkle up your code!  

### Suggested Keybindings:  
Want your neko always near? Add this to your `.vimrc`:  
```vim  
nnoremap <silent> <Leader>c :KawaiiCat<CR>  
nnoremap <silent> <Leader>cs :KawaiiSparkle<CR>  
```  
(I use `\` as `<Leader>`, but feel free to customize, *nya~*!)  

## 🌸 Kawaii Configurations 🌸  
Make your neko match your style:  
```vim  
let g:purrvim_frequency = 10  " How often the neko appears (higher = less).  
let g:purrvim_sleepy_time = 30 " Time before it gets *nemui*.  
```  
Set the purring to your rhythm!
